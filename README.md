# Seed-Test
Behaviour-driven development (BDD) extends the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach by the ‘desired behaviour’ of a software. It is designed to ensure a collaboration between business analysts and developers with explicitly written down scenarios.

## What is Seed-Test?
Seed-Test is a website user interface testing tool, which uses approaches of behaviour-driven development and the notation of Gherkin to enable developers and business users to execute automated tests for their website. It can be tested on the official [website](https://seed-test-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

We are greateful for any testing and feedback, so please help us by filling out this [feedback form](https://seed-test-frontend.herokuapp.com/feedback)

## Installation
To install and use the application localy, clone the repository.
It is necessary to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Install Angular 7:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli 
```
Then install all necessary node modules once in the backend and in the frontend folder:
```
npm install
```

To run the frontend server switch to the frontend folder and use this command:
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
To run the backend server switch to the backend folder and use this command:
```
cd backend
npm start
```

Create an `.env` file with following variables:
```
DATABASE_URI
CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION
FIREFOX_VERSION
REPORT_DELETION_TIME
TESTACCOUNT_NAME
TESTACCOUNT_TOKEN
PORT
```

## Database
Seed-Test uses a MongoDB. You can either create your own locally or in the cloud.
For installation details check out our Check out the [Database Tutorial](https://github.com/adessoCucumber/Cucumber/wiki/Database)

Once you set up the database, insert the uri into the mongodatabase.js file in the backend folder.
Save it!

Then you can set up the database through this command:
```
npm run database
```
This command creates the collections 'Stories' and 'stepTypes' and inserts the current stepTypes into the collection.
The Stories collection can stay empty. It will be automatically filled while accessing the web-app.
