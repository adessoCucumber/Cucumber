# Cucumber App
Behaviour-driven development (BDD) extends the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach by the ‘desired behaviour’ of a software. It is designed to ensure a collaboration between business analysts and developers with explicitly written down scenarios. The basic structure for BDD is:

> **Story**: Returns go to stock

> As a store owner
In order to keep track of stock
I want to add items back to stock when they're returned.

> **Scenario 1**: Refunded items should be returned to stock
Given that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me
And I have three black sweaters in stock.
When they return the black sweater for a refund
Then I should have four black sweaters in stock.

> **Scenario 2**: Replaced items should be returned to stock
Given that a customer previously bought a blue garment from me
And I have two blue garments in stock
And three black garments in stock.
When they return the blue garment for a replacement in black
Then I should have three blue garments in stock
And two black garments in stock.

This project´s goal is to achieve an automated generation of tests from the definitions of the scenarios. 

### Start
To start the frontend and backend application: ``npm start``

### 1. Prototype
The scope of the first prototype is to cover simple web applications and integrate github.com as s story tracking tool. The issues from GitHub are used to create stories (and scenarios) by adding a "story"-tag to them. The test scenarios will only cover some basic web application elements and simple steps.
The first prototype shall include following elements:
- Button
- Input field
- Radio
- Checkbox
- 'Website'

##### Demos
- App: https://cucumber-app.herokuapp.com/
- API (Backend): https://cucumberapp.herokuapp.com/api

### 2. Visualization

### Additional Features we have in mind for further stages:
- Test Reporting
- Feature Templates
- E2E Test execution (e.g. selenium)
- Additional integration of other project management and issue tracking tool (Jira, Redmine etc.)
- Integration in project management and issue tracking tools as a plugin
- Extend the scope to native applications (Java, C# etc.)
- Include additional steps
- Steps editor
- Github authorisation and include own repositories
